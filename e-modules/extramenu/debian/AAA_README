Right off the bat compile problems

```
libtoolize: Consider adding '-I m4' to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am.
configure.ac:20: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_C___ATTRIBUTE__
      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
      See the Autoconf documentation.
autoreconf: /usr/bin/autoconf failed with exit status: 1
dh_autoreconf: error: autoreconf -f -i returned exit code 1
make: *** [debian/rules:10: binary] Error 255
```

Debian stuff gets confused and wants to run configure
rm configure.ac to stop that and it then builds
