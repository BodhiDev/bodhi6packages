FIXME:

Lintian warning,package-installs-python-bytecode, can not be over-ride it is an error of sorts

The proper way to deal with this is to remove the python-byte code during the install
and Move the installation and generation of the python bytecode into the postinst section.

I got tired of messing with it as i have a shit load of packages to build

Needs fixed.
