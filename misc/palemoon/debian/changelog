palemoon (28.14.0-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release: This is a development, bugfix and security update:
    - Updated the browser identity code for website security to more clearly
      indicate website status. A detailed explanation is available on the forum
      and beyond the scope of these release notes.
    - Updated unofficial branding to be more generic and more clearly separate
      unofficial builds from Pale Moon as a product. Please note that this goes
      hand in hand with an update of our redistribution license, and from this
      point forward any "New Moon" products are to be considered separate, and
      not unofficial Pale Moon builds or in any way related to or affiliated
      with Pale Moon, despite the similarity in name.
    - Added a preference (signon.startup.prompt) to give users the option to ask
      for the Master Password the moment the application starts (before the main
      window opens). This allows a workaround for getting multiple Master
      Password prompts if individual components need access to the password
      store at the same time.
    - Changed the way download sources are displayed to always use the actual
      domain downloads are from. In some situations the browser would previously
      display the domain of the referring page in an inconsistent fashion.
    - Implemented the ES2019 Object.fromEntries() utility function.
    - Implemented the CSS flow-root keyword.
    - (Re-)implemented percentage-based CSS opacity values according to the
      updated spec.
    - Implemented the last few missing bits for a standards-compliant
      implementation of JavaScript modules.(preloading, resource: scheme, etc.)
    - Implemented the ResizeObserver DOM API.
    - Fixed a null crash on some websites using CSS clip paths.
    - Updated script handling inside SVGs to only run scripts if they are
      enabled and permitted, avoiding a potential XSS pitfall.
    - Fixed several memory safety hazards and crashes.
    - Updated the MediaQueryList interface to the updated spec. It now inherits
      from EventTarget and implements AddEventListener/RemoveEventListener in
      addition to AddListener/RemoveListener and should improve web compatibility for some sites.
    - Removed support for the archaic and non-standard <marquee> element.
    - Removed some leftovers from the discontinued plugin update checker
      service.
    - Removed some internal HPKP implementation leftovers.
    - Cleaned up the Windows widget code to reduce potentially vulnerable
      direct-dll loads.
    - Security issues fixed: CVE-2020-15676 and CVE-2020-15677

palemoon (28.13.0-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release: This is a development, bugfix and security update.
    - Updated the included site-specific user-agent overrides for a number of
      websites that need them.
    - Rewritten the browser's padlock code to use more modern APIs and provide
      more accurate security status indication.
    - Now also with localized tooltips!
    - Fixed a missing close button on the undo prompt after removing a thumbnail
      from the QuickDial new tab page.
    - Fixed an issue with the alternative stylesheet menu in the browser's UI
      not working.
    - Implemented the use of intrinsic aspect ratios for images to improve
      layout during load and page positioning.
    - Added a preference to the use of node.getRootNode and disabled by default.
      See implementation notes.
    - Added CSS -webkit-appearance as an alias for -moz-appearance to improve
      compatibility with websites that only try to use Chrome-specific keywords to style standard form elements.
    - Updated the SQLite library to 3.33.0.
    - Reinstated precise floating point precision model in JavaScript for those
      alternate builders who foolishly try to use the inaccurate "fast" model.
    - Improved spec compliance of modular JavaScript use (ECMAScript modules).
    - Changed media errors to be a more generic response, and added a preference
      (media.sourceErrorDetails.enabled) to enable detailed error reporting of
      media errors for debugging purposes. Previously, detailed errors were
      provided by default which could lead to privacy issues.
    - Improved code stability of the AbortController implementation.
    - Fixed a race condition in the secure connection library (NSS).
    - Security issues fixed: CVE-2020-15664, CVE-2020-15666, CVE-2020-15667,
      CVE-2020-15668 and CVE-2020-15669.
    - Unified XUL Platform Mozilla Security Patch Summary: 4 fixed, 1
      defense-in-depth, 1 rejected, 9 not applicable.
    Implementation notes:
    - In 28.11.0 we introduced node.getRootNode because some websites would fail
      with an error if this function was not present. Unfortunately, this caused
      problems with other sites that (incorrectly) assume Google WebComponents
      are available when this utility function is present (feature detection
      gone wrong). While it is considered by some to be part of the Google
      WebComponents implementation, it actually has utility value outside of
      that use. Because of the problems caused, we've added a preference and
      disabled it by default, fixing these kinds of websites. When needed, you
      can re-enable this function with dom.getRootNode.enabled. This should
      improve web compatibility by default yet still allow users to enable this
      function for websites that use its utility but do not use WebComponents.

  * Install a palemoon.desktop XFCE helper file from the debian folder so that

        - Improved table drawing performance again after the rewrite for sticky
          positioning, making it slower.
        - Updated CSP processing to allow custom scheme wildcards to be
          specified without a port.
        - Aligned the behavior of outlines with other browsers when dealing with
          CSS-repositioned elements.
        - Changed the way hardware acceleration is controlled from the
          application.
        - Changed the default monospace font for main languages from Courier
          New to Consolas. This provides a more balanced font for fixed-width
          text that is slightly more condensed and more in line with the
          naturally more compact variable-width fonts used everywhere else.
        - Changed the browser's behavior when restoring tabs from previous
          sessions. To prevent stale pages, it will now by default perform a
          "soft refresh" of the page instead of drawing it purely from cache
          without checking if the page needs updating. If you prefer the old
          behavior, set browser.sessionstore.cache_behavior to 0 in
          about:config.
        - Updated NSPR to 4.24 and NSS to ~3.48.1-RTM, removing the previous
          custom patch level with NSS being able to support custom rounds for
          DBM now.
        - For extensive release notes with all NSS changes, see NSS_Releases.
        - Implemented an NSS performance optimization for Master Password use
          with limited effect.
        - Fixed some potential crashing scenarios with WebGL on Linux.
        - Completely removed showModalDialog.
        - Disabled some logging in production builds.
        - Removed various gadgeteering/redundant/dead DOM APIs
          (casting/presentation, FlyWeb).
        - Removed support for a number of critical libraries being
          system-supplied.
        - Removed "Copy raw data" button from the troubleshooting information
          page, since it's never used by us in that format, and users mistakenly
          keep using it instead of copying text.
        - Removed a bunch of Android and iOS support code.
        - Fixed an issue with form elements sometimes being incorrectly
          disabled.
        - Fixed several crashes.
        - Fixed an issue with Captive Portal detection sometimes firing even
          when disabled by the user.
        - Performed various tree-wide code cleanups.
        - Backed out a large code cleanup patch for causing subtle issues in
          website operation (e.g. WordPress). This will have to be revisited
          later; the reintroduced code is not in use in practice.
        - Cleaned up the application updater code.

      - Security-related fixes:
        - Fixed a potential pointer issue issue in cubeb. DiD
        - Disabled allowing remote jar: URIs by default for security reasons. If
          you need this functionality for your non-standard environment, you can
          enable it with the preference network.jar.block-remote-files, but
          please consider moving away from this method of providing web-based
          applications.
        - Removed a potentially dangerous and otherwise ineffective optimization
          from the JavaScript engine.
        - Fixed unwanted behavior where created/focused pop-up windows could
          potentially cover the DOM fullscreen notification, hiding it from
          users. (CVE-2020-6810)
        - Fixed an issue where copying data as a curl request from developer
          tools would not properly escape parameters. (CVE-2020-6811)
        - Updated our sctp library code with several upstream fixes.

      If your special-needs environment requires that you launch the browser
      with custom browser/gre omnijars from the command-line, you must set the
      UXP_CUSTOM_OMNI environment variable before launch from this point
      forward.
    - Fixed an issue in the html parser after using HTML5 template tags,
      allowing JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed,

palemoon (28.8.0+repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New major upstream release:
    - New features:
      - Added support for modern Solaris operating systems like Illumos
        (thanks Athenian200!).
      - Implemented position:sticky for table parts - You can now use CSS to e.g.
        stick table headers so they don't scroll off the screen!
      - Enabled basic implementation of module type scripting. While not fully
        spec compliant (yet), this will fix the few web compatibility issues with
        sites that rely on this feature without fallback (e.g. the Chromium
        bugtracker).
      - Implemented Promise.prototype.finally() (ES2018).
      - Implemented Regular Expression lookbehind (ES2018).
      - Implemented Regular Expression /s flag (dotAll support) (ES2018).
      - Implemented String.prototype.matchAll (regex) (ES2020).
      - Added Ekoru to the list of default search engines. This is a Bing-backed
        search engine that donates the majority of its revenue to various
        charities that support the planet and animals. An environment-supporting
        alternative to Ecosia if you don't want to support Google in the process.

    - Changes/fixes:
      - Changed the way tables are rendered to fix a number of spec compliance
        issues and allow relative positioning of table parts.
      - Removed the unused DiskSpaceWatcher component.
      - Updated cairo code.
      - Updated SQLite to 3.30.1.
      - Updated the Brotli library to 1.0.7.
      - Updated the woff2 library to 1.0.2.
      - Updated the OpenType Sanitizer to 8.0.0.
      - Updated the Javascript math library for precision and performance fixes.
      - Updated the embedded Emoji font to Mozilla's COLR-mapped twemoji 0.5.0
        (Twemoji 12.1.3), to support Emoji 12.
      - Improved CSS grid rendering.
      - Made the second argument of (DOM/CSS) insertRule() optional for (Chrome)
        web compatibility.
      - Removed the non-standard object.prototype.watch()/unwatch() functions.
        Please note that this may affect some extensions; those will need to be
        updated to no longer use these non-standard functions.
      - Fixed the status bar module to work around an issue with relying on
        watch()/unwatch().
      - Fixed a build failure in the libcubeb sndio module.
      - Fixed a small oversight in the release branch that would potentially
        still mark jnlp files as executable.
      - Fixed the certificate retrieval logic in the certificate exception
        dialog.
      - Fixed an issue with add-ons potentially getting confused during add-on
        updates due to cached scripts.
      - Fixed a crash due to unnecessary reparenting calls in layout.
      - Reinstated the mentioning of the number of accelerated/total windows in
        Troubleshooting Information, for completeness.
      - Moved the embedded font for Emoji from application to platform so all
        UXP applications can easily benefit from it (thanks Tobin!).
      - Cleaned up the jemalloc code: Removed dead/unused code, removed
        conditionals around "always on" code, and made the allocator VLA-free.

    - Security-related fixes:
      - Added a preference for, and disabled, the confirmation prompt for URL
        authentication (prevents evil traps).
      - Disabled the use of HPKP by default due to the inherent risks involved
        with this feature. A preference was added to completely disable header
        processing, and using preloaded pins is effectively disabled. Please
        note that this is automatically disabled by default for everyone,
        regardless of your previous setting for this feature, and it is strongly
        recommended you keep this feature disabled. HPKP will eventually be
        removed (overall Internet concensus).
      - Fixed a potential issue when interacting with plugins. (DiD)
      - Fixed a potential crash scenario when reading PAC configuration. (DiD)
      - Fixed a potential issue with text selection painting. (DiD)

      - Fixed a potential issue with clipboard handling. (DiD)
      - Fixed a potential issue with attaching the debugger to web workers. (DiD)
      - Updated NSS to 3.41.4 to address CVE-2019-11756 and CVE-2019-11745.

palemoon (28.7.0+repack-1~mx19+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New major upstream release:
    - Landed a large JavaScript parser tune-up, which as a targeted goal brings
      our ES6 stringification fully in line with the ES2018 revision for
      classes, and implements rest/spread parameters for object literals.
      (Cheers to Luke!)
    - Fixed a crash with the tuned-up parser code when certain error messages
      were triggered.
    - Aligned browser behavior with mainstream regarding inner window behavior
      when domain is manipulated.
    - Improved performance dealing with frame properties.
    - Improved performance for handling html5 strings.
    - Improved performance of image content loading.
    - Fixed potential type confusion in array joins.
    - Fixed an issue on some pages causing high CPU usage when wrongly
      specifying plugin content.
    - Fixed an issue with the add-ons manager "discover" pane if no network
      connection is present.
    - Fixed an issue with bookmark/history search results offering context menu
      options that would be invalid without a selection.
    - Fixed the devtools JSON viewer and enabled it by default.
    - Fixed searching from about:home not working for search plugins using the
      POST method.
    - Fixed an issue with the checkboxes for location bar preferences.

      sizes, causing blurry display of especially small SVGs like icons/glyphs.
    - SVGs will now always be pixel-snapped to provide expected crisp display.
    - Fixed precompilation of Sync client modules when packaging. This also
      removes the redundant services.sync.enabled pref.
    - Added support for matroska containers and h264-based webm video formats.
    - Added support for AAC audio in matroska and webm video formats.

  * Import new 28.6.1 security and bugfix update:
    - Improved handling of FTP resource loading (allow save-as and cater to some
      FTP-based browsing).
    - Added a preference (security.block_ftp_subresources) to allow users to
      completely bypass the blocking of FTP subresources if required for their
      environment, if the improvements made in this release do not suffice.
    - Added blocking of authentication-locked cross-origin image subresources by
      default to prevent spurious auth prompts.
    - A preference (network.auth.subresource-http-img-XO-auth) was added to
      allow users to bypass this blocking if required for their environment.
    - Changed the behavior of file: URIs to treat each URI as a unique origin.
      This prevents cross-file access from scripting.
    - A preference (security.fileuri.unique_origin) was added to allow users to
      relax this restriction if required for their environment.

      safety issues.
    - Aligned browser behavior with mainstream regarding inner window behavior
      when domain is manipulated.

  * Out-of-band update to fix some pressing issues:
    - Updated the application icon to provide better visuals on Windows classic
      and other grey backgrounds.
    - Reduced the Master Password hashing rounds to prevent issues with stored
      password retrieval while still sufficiently strengthening the encryption.
      If you have previously re-keyed the database after the update to 28.6.0,
      you should do so again by going through the change master password process
      to reduce access times.
    - Updated the WhatsApp Web site-specific user-agent override to respond to
      Google refusing access based on the old string.
    - Updated the branding for the portable launcher.

palemoon (28.6.0+repack-1~mx17+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * Major development update, focusing on under-the-hood improvements and
    bugfixes, code cleanup, and performance:

    - Implemented String.prototype.trimStart and String.prototype.trimEnd
      (ES2019)
    - Implemented Array.prototype.flat and Array.prototype.flatMap (ES2019)
    - Implemented Symbol.prototype.description (ES2019)
    - Added support for gzip-compressed SVG-in-Opentype fonts.
    - Updated official branding.
    - Updated reader view components.
    - Added a preference to control the setting of cookies through meta header
      information (non-standard feature) and disabled by default.
    - Updated ES6 Atomics and re-enabled them.
    - Updated internationalization code to support updated time zones and the
      Japanese Reiwa era.
    - Updated NSS to a custom version to have better encryption strength for
      master passwords.
      IMPORTANT: To use this strong encryption and re-key the password database
      with it, change your master password (can be changed to the same one you
      already had if desired, but you have to go through the change password
      process). Depending on your computer and the number of stored passwords,
      this encryption update may take some time, so please be patient. Please be
      aware that once re-keyed, the password store will be locked to the new
      encryption and will no longer be accessible with the master password in
      older versions of Pale Moon.

    - Reverted the 28.5.1 change to treat *.jnlp files as executables
      (CVE-2019-11696) after input from an Oracle representative. Java Web Start
      files are not executable and should not be treated any different than
      regular documents handled by external applications.

palemoon (28.3.1+repack-1~mx17+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream minor security and stablility release:
    - Disabled the IntersectionObserver API by default while we work on
      resolving crashes caused by it.
    - Added isIntersecting to the IntersectionObserver API per specification.
    - Added an option to the preferences window to enable Captive Portal
      detection (Advanced -> General). If your network connection regularly
      encounters Captive Portals (e.g. using a laptop on the road or other WiFi
      connections that require login or agreement to terms) then enabling this
      detection may make your use of such networks more convenient.
      For those worried about privacy: the detection service makes use of our own
      infrastructure and does not contact third parties like Apple or Google.

palemoon (28.3.0+repack-1~mx17+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * Import new 28.3.0 major development and bugfix release:
    - Added AV1 support for MP4/MSE videos. Please note that this is a reference
      library implementation and the upstream decoding lib currently has poor
      performance for higher resolutions (720p+). This is disabled by default;
      use the about:config preference media.av1.enabled to enable this codec.
    - Changed the API used for video playback with FFmpeg 58+. This should solve
      performance issues (dropped frames) with VP8 and VP9.
    - Redesigned the main toolbar icons as SVG images to make them HiDPI
      compliant.
    - Fixed the sync notification (infobar) icon.
    - Fixed a potential cycle collector resource leak.
    - Added icons and controls to tabs to indicate if sound is playing the tab
      and if so, allowing the user to mute it with a click. This is a native
      implementation of the API in use in Basilisk and performs the same
      function as the "expose noisy tabs" extension, although the extension may
      still be preferred by some for e.g. skinning capabilities. The feature may
      be disabled with browser.tabs.showAudioPlayingIcon.
    - Removed support for VR hardware.
    - Fixed out-of-bounds sizes for CSS calculation strings.
    - Removed the DirectShow component since it is no longer necessary.
    - Removed Firefox Accounts integration, phase 1:
      - Changed the Sync client to the one from Tycho.
      - Made Sync optional at build time.
    - Stopped trying to cater to addons.mozilla.org since they no longer offer
        anything useful to Pale Moon after the Great XUL Extension Purge™.
    - Added an option to process favicons for optimal sized display and removing
      animations. Enable this with browser.chrome.favicons.process
    - Fixed an incorrect preference reference in feed reader.
    - Fixed an issue with lazy frame construction on display:contents elements.
      This should solve e.g. the use of mathjax in comments on stackoverflow.
    - Media code improvements and cleanup (ongoing).
    - Updated the DropBox useragent override to solve login issues.
    - Fixed potential crashes due to shutdown observers in VTT and font
      lists. DiD
    - Enabled some mistakingly-disabled optimizations in the JS JIT compiler.
    - Fixed several potential crashes in JS. DiD
    - Fixed several potential crashes in WebCrypto. DiD
    - Fixed a potential crash in JS Range Analysis. DiD
    - Fixed a potential crash in the layout engine due to combo boxes. DiD
    - Fixed a potential shutdown crash in non-standard environments related to
      2D Canvas. DiD
    - Fixed a potential overflow in the PNG writer. DiD
    - Fixed a potential double-free in the MAR signing utility. DiD
    - Fixed an issue where URLs could be extracted cross-origin (CVE-2018-18494).
    - Updated NSPR to v4.20.
    - Updated NSS to 3.41, providing (among other things) full compatibility with
      the final version of TLS 1.3 on websites.
    - Updated location.protocol to the latest spec.
    - Updated Intersection Observers to the latest spec and enabled them
      by default.
    - Updated the SQLite lib to 3.26.0.
    - Fixed errors about the login manager's recipeManager not being
      available (yet).
    - Switched status bar download arrow to SVG.
    - Fixed a crash in IntersectionObservers.
    - Fixed initialization of the Search service from browser code to avoid
      synchronous init.
    - Added logging of performance warnings to devtools consoles.
    - Fixed favicons in taskbar tab preview listings.
    - Blocked Comodo IS dll < version 6.3 to prevent startup crashes.
    - Fixed issues in the HTML form submit observer module.
    - Limited resolving depth of CSS variables to a sane maximum (fixes
      cras.sh issue).
    - Removed Mozilla's proprietary constructor on WebAudio's AudioContext,
      aligning it with the standard specification.
    - Exposed the previously hidden preference in about:config for page thumbnail
      generation (some people prefer this for local privacy).
    - Aligned Element.ScrollIntoView with the DOM specification. This improves,
      among other things, compatibility with the React framework.

  * Totally revise debian/copyright to conform to Debian Policy.
  * Install copies of MPL-1.1 and MPL-2 licenses in docs.

palemoon (28.2.0~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * Import new 28.2.0 major development and bugfix release:
    - Fixed a major performance issue with web workers.
    - Fixed a rare crash on local networks with HTTP basic auth and unsupported
      cipher suites.
    - Fixed a performance/timer issue when leaving the browser idle.
    - Fixed an issue causing an empty dialog when launching executable files
      from the browser.
    - Fixed an issue preventing making entries to disallow sites to store data
      for off-line use.
    - Removed code to prevent extensions with binary components.
    - Fixed an issue with common dialogs being sized incorrectly for their
      content.
    - Fixed an issue with event handling on the tab bar that would cause
      frustrating behavior when trying to open/close tabs in rapid succession.
    - Switched default behavior for scrolling when a context or pop-up menu is
      open to allow scrolling, like in v27. This also affects scrolling in very
      long menus, e.g. bookmarks.
    - Added experimental Asynchronous Panning and Zooming (APZ) for desktop use.
    - Re-enabled the use and parsing of ICC v4 color profiles.
    - Removed telemetry code from the caching subsystem.
    - Improved full-screen detection for suppressing status messages.
    - Made all arguments passed to Init*Event() optional except the first for
      parity with other browsers.
    - Cleaned up some internal installer code.
    - Fixed making caret width configurable when dealing with CJK characters
      (regression).
    - Fixed drawing of table borders consistently when zooming a page
      (regression).
    - Exposed the "Save download location per site" pref in about:config.
    - Improved media handling (ongoing).
    - Added experimental support for AV1 in WebM videos (disabled by default).
    - Note: this is for WebM only for now, so MP4 and MSE AV1 streams (e.g.
      YouTube) will not (yet) play.
    - Removed the (defunct and incomplete) in-browser translation code.
    - Fixed an issue with CSS Grid layouts unnecessarily shrinking element
      blocks.
    - Fixed notification settings menu entry (opes about:permissions with
      relevant data now).
    - Fixed the launching of an undesirable background content process for
      capturing page thumbnails.
    - Fixed a focus issue in the bookmark properties dialog.
    - Changed the setting for reporting CSS errors to the console to false by
      default, to prevent unnecessary performance loss for recording this data.
    - Added control mechanisms for Opportunistic Encryption (both for
      alternative services and upgrade-insecure-requests) in preferences,
      and disabled this by default due to potential security and privacy issues
      with this transitional technology.
    - Updated the default reported Firefox version in Firefox Compatibility Mode
      to prevent "too old Firefox" complaints on websites.
    - Updated libnestegg, ffvpx, reader view components and several other
      modules from upstream.
    - Implemented security fixes for CVE-2018-12381, CVE-2017-7797, a better fix
      for CVE-2018-12386 (DiD), CVE-2018-12401 (DiD), CVE-2018-12398,
      CVE-2018-12392, several Skia bugs, and several crashes and memory safety
      hazards that do not have a CVE number.

  * debian/mozconfig: enable AV1 decoding.

palemoon (28.1.0~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:

    - Updated NSS to 3.38, removed TLS 1.3 draft version check since it's
      considered final.
    - Reinstated RC4 as an optional encryption cypher for non-standard
      environments (e.g. old routing/peripheral networked hardware on LAN). RC4
      and 3DES are marked weak and disabled, and will never be used in the first
      handshake with a site, only as last-ditch fallback when specifically
      enabled (meaning they won't show up on ssllabs' test, for example).
    - Removed Telemetry accumulation calls, automatic timers and stopwatches.
      This removes a very noticeable performance sink for all operations on all
      platforms.
    - Fixed many occurrences of discouraged types of memory access for primarily
      GCC 8 compatibility. This improves overall code security as a
      defense-in-depth measure.
    - Re-implemented the pref-controlled custom background color for
      standalone images.
    - Updated session history handling for internal pages. about:logopage is no
      longer stored in history, and you can choose to store the QuickDial page in
      history by setting the pref browser.newtabpage.add_to_session_history to
      true. This is disabled by default (meaning you can't use the "Back" button
      to go back to the QuickDial page) as a defense-in-depth security measure.
    - Added ui.menu.allow_content_scroll to control whether content can be
      scrolled if a context menu is open.
    - Fixed incorrect code removal in ipc.
    - Removed support for TLS session caches in TLSServerSocket.
    - Added support for local-ref as SVG xlink:href values.
    - Changed the find bar to be a browser-global toolbar again (like in Pale
      Moon 27) instead of per-tab. For people who prefer search terms to be
      saved on a per-tab basis (like with the per-tab findbar previously), this
      is possible by setting findbar.termPerTab to true. This resolves a number
      of issues, including styling with lightweight themes not applying to the
      find bar, and status pop-ups overlapping the find bar.
    - Ported all relevant security fixes from Mozilla's Gecko/62 release,
      including CVE-2018-12377 and CVE-2018-12379.
    - Restored part of the searchplugin API that was removed by Mozilla, so
      extensions can provide and save edits to installed search engines.
    - Improved the speed of restoring browsing sessions upon startup.
    - Fixed the "Restore previous session" button sometimes being missing from
      about:home, while a restorable session would be present.
    - Fixed tab previews in the Windows taskbar (if enabled).
    - Fixed the setting of the new tab page being "My Home Page" so it'll pick up
      subsequent changes to the home page URL automatically.
    - Removed the Firefox Accounts migrator from Sync.
    - Fixed an issue with the enabled state of number controls if appearances
      changed.
    - Stopped building ffvpx on 32-bit platforms (except Windows) to use the
      (faster) system-installed lib instead.
    - Re-added a horizontal scroll action option for mouse wheel. (regression)
    - Fixed handling of content language if the locale is changed.
    - Fixed document navigation with the F6 key.
    - Fixed toolbar styling in toolkit themes.
    - Fixed viewing the source of a selection.

  * Import new upstream 27.9.4 release.
    - Updated the useragent for addons.mozilla.org to work around their "Only
      with Firefox" discrimination preventing users from downloading themes, old
      versions of extensions, and other files with Pale Moon.
    - Restricted web access to the moz-icon:// scheme that could potentially be
      abused to infringe the user's privacy.
    - Prevented various location-based threats. DiD
    - Fixed a potential vulnerability with plugins being redirected to different
      origins (CVE-2018-12364).
    - Improved the security check for launching executable files
      (by association) on Windows from the browser. For users who have (most
      likely accidentally) granted a system-wide waiver for opening these kinds
      of files without being prompted, this permission has been reset.
    - Fixed an issue with invalid qcms transforms (CVE-2018-12366).
    - Fixed a buffer overflow using the computed size of canvas elements
      (CVE-2018-12359).

  * New upstream security and stability update:

    - Changes/fixes:
      - We changed the language strings for softblocked items so people will cry
        less when we do our job.
      - (CVE-2018-5174) Prevent potential SmartScreen bypass on Windows 10.
      - (CVE-2018-5173) Fixed an issue in the Downloads panel improperly
        rendering some Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be
        spoofed. This could be used to obscure the file extension of potentially
        executable files from user view in the panel.
      - (CVE-2018-5177) Fixed a vulnerability in the XSLT component leading to a
        buffer overflow and crash if it occurs.
      - (CVE-2018-5159) Fixed an integer overflow vulnerability in the Skia
        library resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes.
      - (CVE-2018-5154) Fixed a use-after-free vulnerability while enumerating
        attributes during SVG animations with clip paths.
      - (CVE-2018-5178) Fixed a buffer overflow during UTF8 to Unicode string
        conversion within JavaScript with extremely large amounts of data. This
        vulnerability requires the use of a malicious or vulnerable extension in

palemoon (27.9.1~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream maintenance update:
    - Removed the unused/incomplete places protocol handler.
    - Worked around an issue with MSE media without a Track ID. This should help
      with the playability of some live streams.
    - Ported across jemalloc improvements from UXP.
    - Ported across cairo mutex improvements from UXP.
    - Added support for FFmpeg 4.0/libavcodec 58.
    - Added a fix for Windows 10's "isAlpha()" not being what one would expect
      in v1803.

palemoon (27.9.0~repack-1~mx17+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a number of spec compliance issues in our media subsystem.
    - Added a trailing slash to referrers when policy is set to fix some web
      compatibility issues.
    - Fixed the property order in Object.getOwnPropertyNames(string) and others
      for web compatibility.
    - Updated RegExp(RegExp object, flags) to the ES6 standard specification.
    - Changed the embedded font from the no longer free EmojiOne to the
      open-licensed Twemoji (with additional fixes). This also further extends
      unicode support to Unicode 10 emoji(s). Please note that as a result, color
      emoji(s) will look different than before.
    - Adjusted some things in our memory allocator code to provide, among other
      things, better allocation alignment on Windows.
    - Made the attempt to migrate people from the old sync server domain name to
      the current one more aggressive. We will be retiring the old
      pmsync.palemoon.net Sync server address shortly to remove the need for us
      to maintain a security certificate for it; this preference migration should
      automatically put everyone on the correct server address when upgrading.
    - Made reading of the sessionstore synchronous, to speed up startup and
      prevent the homepage from being loaded when restoring a session.
    - Added a fix to switch to the correct window/tab when a web notification
      is clicked.
    - Changed the placeholder text to not include "Search" when all search
      functions from the address bar are disabled.
    - Enabled the use of Skia for canvas on Linux and OSX.
    - Worked around a potential cause for some non-standard bitmapped fonts
      ending up with incorrect line heights (I'm looking at you, Noto fonts!).
    - Added a workaround for incorrectly-encoded JPEG-XR images with planar
      alpha. Ultimately, the jxrlib reference implementation should be fixed to
      encode according to spec.
    - Aligned XCTO:nosniff allowed script MIME types with the updated spec.
    - Improved the logic for storing vector images in the surface cache.
    - Fixed character set handling for XMLHttpRequests.

    - Fixed (CVE-2018-5129) OOB Write.
    - Updated the lz4 library to 1.8.0 to solve potential issues. DiD
    - Fixed (CVE-2018-5137) Path traversal on chrome:// URLs
    - Fixed several memory safety an synchronicity hazards.

  * New upstream release:
    - Backed out the NSPR/NSS update from 27.8.0 for causing crashes, general
      operational instability and handshake issues.
    - Disabled TLS 1.3 draft support by default, because with the NSS backout we
      only support an older draft right now that is no longer current and may
      cause connectivity issues. You can manually re-enable it at your own risk
      in about:config by setting security.tls.version.max to 4.

palemoon (27.8.0~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for emojis on Windows systems that have relatively poor
      support for them with standard font sets by including our own font
      (EmojiOne based for now).
    - Added a setting in preferences to select the use of tab previews with
      Ctrl+Tab.
    - Added Eyedropper menu entry to the AppMenu.
    - Added a preference to control whether the text cursor (caret) should be
      thicker when dealing with CJK characters or not (default = yes).
    - Added URL fix-ups for schemes (mis-typed "ttp://" etc.).
    - Added support for ES6 "Symbol species".
    - Updated our TLS 1.3 support to the latest (probably final) draft.
    - Fixed gap inconsistency in the tabstrip.
    - Fixed a number of browser crashes.
    - Fixed a crash with the exponentiation operator "**"
    - Set the performance timer granularity to 1 ms.
    - Updated the kiss-fft library to our forked 1.4.0 version.
    - Disabled a potentially problematic optimization on Win 8+ with high
      contrast themes in use.
    - Removed the notification bar when in full screen to prevent unwanted
      visible screen elements.
    - Removed unmaintained and insecure WebRTC code - building with WebRTC
      enabled is no longer an option.
    - Removed redundant checks for "Vista or later" since that is all we support.
    - Added display of the http status to raw request displays.
    - Added a workaround for cloned videos not retaining their muted state.
    - Added a temporary workaround to avoid crashes on trackless media.
    - Removed some superfluous ellipses from menu labels.
    - Fixed undesired shrinking of line heights as a result of setting minimum
      font size in preferences.
    - Fixed some issues with setting the new tab preference (regression).

  * Add support for building on Debian Buster on gcc-4.9.

palemoon (27.7.2~repack-1~mx17+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Changed the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff behavior to only check
      "success" class server responses, for web compatibility reasons.
    - Changed the perfomance timer resolution once more to a granularity of
      1 ms, after evaluating more potential ways of abusing Spectre. This
      takes the most cautious approach possible lacking more information
      (because apparently NDAs have been signed over this between mainstream
      players), follows Safari's lead, and should make it not just infeasible
      but downright impossible to use these timers for nefarious purposes in
      this context.
    - Improved the debug-only startup cache wrapper to prevent a rare crash.
    - Fixed a crash in the XML parser.
    - Added a check for integer overflow in AesTask::DoCrypto()
      (CVE-2018-5122) DiD
    - Fixed a potential race condition in the browser cache.
    - Fixed a crash in HTML media elements (CVE-2018-5102)
    - Fixed a crash in XHR using workers.
    - Fixed a crash with some uncommon FTP operations.
    - Fixed a potential race condition in the JAR library.

palemoon (27.7.1~repack-1~mx17+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for Array.prototype[@@unscopables].
      Unfortunately, the addition of Javascript's ES6 Unscopables in 27.7.0 was
      incomplete, which caused a number of websites (e.g. Chase on-line banking,
      some Russian government sites) to display blank or not complete loading
      after updating to that version of the browser. This update should fix the
      problem by adding the missing part of the feature.
    - Fixed an issue with the default theme causing tab borders to be drawn too
      thick at higher settings for visual element scaling (125/150%) in Windows.

palemoon (27.7.0~repack-1~mx17+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Reorganized access to preferences (moved to the Tools menu on Linux, and
      renamed from "Options" to "Preferences" on Windows).
    - Renamed "Restart with add-ons disabled" to "Restart in Safe Mode" to
      better reflect what it does.
    - Worked around an issue with some improperly-encoded PNG files not decoding
      after our libpng update.
    - Fixed an issue on Mac builds not properly populating the application menu.
    - Added "My home page" as an option for new tabs.
    - Added an option to disable the 4th and 5th mouse buttons (Windows).
    - (mouse.button4.enabled and mouse.button5.enabled, respectively)
    - Improved the resetting of non-default profiles.
    - Fixed an issue with details/summary having the incorrect height if floated,
      breaking layouts.
    - Implemented support for flex/columnset contents inside buttons to align
      its behavior with other browsers.
    - (this should fix layout issues with Twitch's new web interface)
    - Made several more improvements to the details/summary tags to align them
      with the current spec and fix several bugs.
    - Fixed an issue where CSS clone operations would draw a border.
    - Changed the way fractional border widths are rounded to provide more
      natural behavior.
    - Fixed an issue where number inputs would incorrectly be flagged as
      read-only.
    - Added assets for tile display in the Windows start panel.
    - Finished sync infra swapover by adding a one-time pref migration for
      server used.
    - Improved WebAudio API: Return the connected audio node from
      AudioNode.connect()
    - Added support for a default playback start position in media elements.
    - Fixed an assert in cubeb-alsa code (Linux).
    - Added support for media cue-change events (e.g. subtitles).
    - Updated SQLite to 3.21.0.

    - Fixed devtools (gcli) screenshots on vertical-text pages.
    - Fixed devtools copy as cURL for POST requests.
    - Improved the HTML editor component (several bugfixes).
    - Added support for ES7's exponentiation a ** b operator.
    - Fixed an issue with arrow functions incorrectly creating an arguments
      binding.
    - Added Javascript's ES6 unscopables.
    Security/privacy fixes:
    - Disabled automatic filling in of log-in details by default to prevent
      potential risks of credentials being abused (e.g. for tracking) or stolen.
    - Added a preference (in the category security) to easily enable or disable
      automatic filling in of log-in data.
    - Removed the sending of referrers when opening a link in a new
      private window.
    - Added an option to disable the page visibility Web API
      (dom.visibilityAPI.enabled), allowing users to prevent pages from knowing
      whether they are being actively displayed to the user or not.
    - Removed the "ask every time" policy for cookies. For granular control,
      please use any of the excellent available extensions to regulate cookie use
      on a per-site or per-url basis.
    - Added support for X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (for scripts).
    - Changed the resolution of performance timers to a level where any future
      potential abuse for hardware-timing attacks becomes impractical.

palemoon (27.6.2~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * Minor security and bugfix release:
    - Implemented the concept of so-called "cookie-averse document objects",
      which is a security&privacy measure that blocks certain web content from
      setting cookies. This mitigates cookie-injection, which might help against
      "hidden" cookie tracking.
    - Mitigated some domain name spoofing through IDN by using dotless-i and
      dotless-j with accents. (CVE-2017-7832)
    - Pale Moon will display these kinds of spoofed domains in punycode now in
      the actual address bar. Please note that the identity panel will always be
      able to help you on secure sites when IDNs are in use to notice potential
      spoofing, as opposed to relying on detection algorithms in the URL itself.
      As such, some other issues like CVE-2017-7833 are already mitigated by us.
    - Fixed an issue with mixed-content blocking. (CVE-2017-7835)
    - Added an extra check for the correct signature data type on certificates.
    - Added missing sanitization in exporting bookmarks to HTML. (CVE-2017-7840)
    - Fixed several crashes and memory safety hazards.
  * Bump debhelper build-depend to >= 9.

      command-line or file association, focus issues on new windows, not
      loading the home page in a new window, etc.)
    - Aligned XHR with the currect spec to allow withCredentials.
    - Fixed an input element focus issue within handlers.
    - Fixed the processing of all-padding HTTP/2 frames to prevent rare
      HTTP/2 hangups.
    - Updated CitiBank override to work around their login issues.
    - Updated Netflix override to a community-supplied one that seems to
      satisfy their arbitrary restrictions better.

      black-on-white.
    - Changed the theme styling on Windows 10 when the system window frame is
      used (menu bar enabled) to use the window manager background directly,
      preventing visual lag updating the window color when it changes.
    - Updated user agent overrides for DropBox, YouTube and Yahoo to work around
      user agent sniffing issues.
    - Fixed a crash in the media subsystem.
    - Fixed a regression where video playback hardware acceleration was disabled
      incorrectly on some systems.

palemoon (27.4.0~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release--the github 27.4.0 was not a real release:
    Changes/fixes:
    - Completely re-worked the Media Source Extensions code to make it spec
      compliant, and asynchronous as per specification for MSE with MP4. This
      should fix playback problems on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo and other sites
      that previously had some issues. A massive thank you to Travis for his
      tireless work on making this happen!
      Please note that MSE+WebM (disabled by default) is not using this new code
      yet (planned for the next release), and as such there is a temporary set
      of things to keep in mind if you don't use default settings:
        If you have previously enabled MSE+WebM, this setting will be reset when
        you update to avoid conflicting settings with the updated MSE code.
        We've added an extra setting in Options to disable the updated MSE code
        (asynchronous use) in case you need to use WebM or are otherwise having
        issues with the updated code (please let us know in that case).
        Once again, the MSE+WebM and Asynchronous MSE use are currently mutually
        exclusive. You can have one or the other, not both, until we sort out
        the code for WebM. To enable MSE+WebM you will first have to disable
        Asynchronouse MSE in settings (otherwise the WebM setting will be greyed
        out and disabled).
    - Added a control in options/preferences for HSTS and HPKP usage.
    - Changed HTML bookmark exports to write CRLF line endings to the file on
      Windows.
    - Leveraged multi-core rendering for libVPX (VP8/VP9 WebM decoding).
    - Fixed some issues accessing DeviantArt (useragent-sniffing).
    - Aligned CSS text-align with the spec.
    - Added a recovery module for browser initialization issues (e.g. when using
      a wrong language pack).
    - Fixed spurious console errors for XHR requests with certain http response
      codes.
    - Enabled v-sync aligned refresh for a smoother scrolling experience.
    - Removed support for CSS XP-theme media queries.
    - Improved console error reporting.
    - Fixed resetting toolbars and controls from the safe mode dialog.
    - Fixed bookmark recovery option from the safe mode dialog.
    - Fixed innerText getters for display:none elements.
    - Fixed a GL buffer crash that might occur with certain combinations of
      drivers and hardware.
    - Added some more details to about:support.
    - Fixed a potential crash when the last audio device is removed during
      playback.
    - Fixed a crash on about:support when windowless browsers are created.
    - Updated <select> elements to blank if the actively set value doesn't match
      any of the options.
    - Updated the interpretation of 2-digit years in date formats to match other
      browsers:
     - 0-49 = 2000-2049, 50-99 = 1950-1999.
    - Added "q" units to CSS (quarter of a millimeter).
    - Added .origin property to blobs.
    - Fixed several minor layout issues.
    - Fixed disabled HTML elements not producing the proper JS events.
    - Implemented web content handler blacklist according to the spec, allowing
      more than feeds to be registered.
    - Fixed a spec compliance issue with execCommand() on HTML elements.
    - Fixed a problem with table borders being drawn uneven or being omitted
      when zooming the page.
    - Added devtools "filter URLs" option in the network panel.
    - Added visual sorting options to the Network inspector.
    - Added importing of login data from Chrome profiles on Windows (Chrome
      has to be closed first).
    - Added importing of tags from bookmark export files (HTML format).
    - Updated usage of SourceMap headers with the updated spec (SourceMap
      header, keeping X-SourceMap as a fallback).
    - Fixed several cases of wrongly-used negations in JS modules.
    - Added the auxclick mouse event.
    - Added a control to not autoplay video unless it is in view
     (media.block-play-until-visible).
    - Updated the Graphite font library to 1.3.10.
    - Updated how image and media elements respond to window size changes
      (responsive design).
    - Added parsing and use of rotation meta data in video.
    - Fixed several crashes in a number of modules.
    - Fixed performance regression for scaling large vector images (e.g. MSIE
      Chalkboard test) \o/
    - Fixed some issues with notification icons.
    - Fixed some internal errors with live bookmarks.
    - Updated SQLite to 3.19.3.
    - Fixed several reported issues with devtools (cli-cookies, cli help,
      copying cURL, inspecting SVGs, element size calculations, etc.)
    - Fixed an issue where a server response was allowed to override add-ons'
      specified version ranges even for add-ons that have strict compatibility
      (e.g. themes, language packs).

    Security fixes:

    - Removed preloading of HPKP hosts and enabled HPKP header enforcement.
    - Added support for TLS 1.3, the up-next secure connection protocol.
    - Fixed an issue with TLS 1.3 not supporting renegotiation by design.
    - Relaxed some restrictions for CSP to temporarily work around web
      compatibility issues with the CSP-3 deprecated `child-src` directive.
    - Updated NSS to 3.28.5.1-PM to address some security issues.
    - Updated the installer selfextractor module to address unsafe loading of
      libraries.
    - Changed the way certain resources are included to reduce effectiveness of
      some common fingerprinting techniques. (e.g. browserleaks.org)
    - Fixed a regression in the display of security information in the page info
      dialog for insecure content.
    - Fixed two potential issues with allocating memory for video. DiD
    - Fixed a potential issue with the network prediction algorithm. DiD
    - Restricted the use of Aspirational scripts in IDNs to prevent domain
      spoofing, in anticipation of the UAX#31 update making this official.
    - Prevented a Mac font specific issue that could be abused for domain
      spoofing (CVE-2017-7763)
    - Fixed several potentially exploitable crashes. (CVE-2017-7751)
      (CVE-2017-7757) and some that do not have a CVE designation.

palemoon (27.2.1~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:

    - Changes/Fixes:
      - Fixed an issue with planar alpha handling (transparency) when drawing
        JXR images.
      - Fixed a crash related to a change JavaScript array handling introduced
        in 27.2.0. This became apparent with the pentadactyl extension, but
        could happen in other situations as well.
      - Fixed a crash when opening ridiculously large images with HQ scaling
        enabled (default). Pale Moon will now only apply HQ scaling for images
        within reasonable limits (64 Mpix or smaller). Images larger than that
        may not display properly when zooming in, or may not display at all,
        even scaled down (e.g. >256 Mpix large) and show a "broken image"
        placeholder instead; please use dedicated image viewer applications for
        those kinds of images; it is outside the scope of a web browser to
        handle such large images.
      - Changed the way URL hashes are handled, and will no longer %-decode
        anchor hash identifiers by default. Note that this is against RFC 3986,
        which states that any part of the URL scheme that isn't data should be
        decoded. This is required for web compatibility because several sites
        use hash links to pass actual data to web applications (Please don't do
        this! Hashes are part of the URL address, should only consist of "safe"
        characters, and aren't suited to pass arbitrary data) and the most
        common browsers no longer follow the RFC in that respect. If you want
        RFC compliance, switch dom.url.getters_decode_hash to true.
      - Restored 2 RSA Camellia cipher suites that were missing:
        TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA and TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA.
      - Fixed an issue with custom toolbars getting deleted during upgrade
        from 27.0/27.1 to 27.2

palemoon (27.2.0~repack-1mx15+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:

    - Changes/Fixes:
      - Updated the ICU lib to 58.2 to fix a number of issues.
      - Added proper control for the user for offline storage for web
        applications.
      - Added a check to prevent auto-filled URLs from copying the auto-filled
        selection to clipboard/primary.
      - Added the feature to pass a URL to open in a private window from the
        command-line.
      - Improved the display of the downloads indicator on the button in
        bright-text situations.
      - DOM storage now honors the "3rd party cookie" setting in that it will
        not allow 3rd party data to be stored if 3rd party cookies are
        disallowed.
      - Allowed toolbar button badges to be properly styled.
      - Updated the hunspell spellchecking library to 1.6.0 to fix a number
        of issues.
      - Fixed desktop notifications being off-screen if fired in rapid
        succession.
      - Added Element.insertAdjacentElement and Element.insertAdjacentText
        DOM functions.
      - Added support for JPEG-XR images. This makes Pale Moon have the broadest
        support for image formats of all web browsers. (enabled by default; you
        can disable this with media.jxr.enabled).
      - Completely removed the use of GStreamer on Linux.
      - Added support for Element.innerText.
      - Custom toolbars should now properly remember their state.
      - Fixed some more playback issues with MP4/MSE videos. Please be aware
        that we are still working on further improving MSE video handling.
      - Changed media processing to reduce dangerous processing asynchronicity.
        This should also make media elements and playback more responsive.
      - Fixed a useragent string regression always displaying the minor Goanna
        version as .0
      - Updated NSPR to 4.13.1.
      - Updated NSS to 3.28.3-RTM.
      - Fixed unrestricted icon sizes in PMkit buttons.
      - Fixed unresponsive buttons on support page when not building
        the updater.
      - Fixed the use of "View image" and "Save image as" on extremely
        large images.
      - Changed the way "View Image" and "Save image as" work on canvas
        elements.
      - Made checking for dangerously large resolution PNG images smarter. It
        will now accept larger "strip"-aspect ratio images while reducing
        unsupported large image resolutions. This will e.g. fix Gmail's "emoji"
        window that uses a ridiculously long but very narrow single image to
        store all the emoticon pictures.
      - Converted several hard-coded URLs to preferences.
      - Updated the google.com override so it would not cripple services based
        on UA sniffing.
      - Added Inner and Outer Window ID administration.
      - Fixed the add-on discovery pane detection.
      - Added support for canvas ellipse.
      - Improved drawing of certain MathML elements at problematic zoom levels.
      - No longer building gamepad support.
      - Updated Harfbuzz font shaper to 1.4.3 to fix a number of issues.
      - Fixed a number of crashes (layout, plugins, uncommon navigation,
        bad URLs).
      - Aligned SVG specular filters with the spec.

    - Security/privacy changes:
      - Added support for 256-bit AES-GCM encryption.
      - Added support for ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption.
      - Removed support for Camellia-GCM since nobody seems interested in it.
        (Camellia in 128/256-bit CBC block mode is still fully supported).
      - Added support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 to Crypto utils.
      - Improved status handling of secure sites to be less sensitive to
        "insecure" items that are local.

      - Fixed a potentially exploitable crash in OnStartRequest. (CVE-2017-5416)
      - Fixed potential cross-origin content-stealing through a timing
        attack. (CVE-2017-5407)
      - Fixed a denial-of-service problem with view-source. (CVE-2017-5422)
      - Fixed crash in directional controls. (CVE-2017-5413)
      - Fixed a perceived problem with chrome manifests. (CVE-2017-5427)
      - Fixed the use of an uninitialized value. (CVE-2017-5405)
      - Fixed a buffer overflow. (CVE-2017-5412)
      - Fixed a UAF situation. (CVE-2017-5403)
      - Fixed a potential spoofing issue with the address bar. (CVE-2017-5417)
      - Fixed a potential issue in libvpx. (CVE-2017-5402) DiD
      - Fixed a potential issue with HTTP auth. (CVE-2017-5418)
      - Fixed several memory safety hazards and potentially exploitable crashes.

palemoon (27.1.0~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New major upstream release:
    - Reworked the media back-end completely (thanks Travis!) to use FFmpeg
      (including support for FFmpeg v3 and MP3 playback) and our own MP4 parser,
      and no longer relying on gstreamer on Linux, as well as adding some
      improvements on Windows for media parsing and playing.
    - On Linux, Apple .mov files of the correct type will also be played through
      FFmpeg now, for those rare occasions where they are still in use,
      considering there is no Quicktime plug-in available on that operating
      system.
    - Restored the classic about:config styling.
    - Added a fallback to US-ASCII if the autoconfig UTF-8 conversion fails.
    - Improved cross-compartment wrapper handling when managing a large number
      of tabs (fixes a performance regression with v27).
    - Changed the way audio and video synchronization is calculated to account
      for (slow) device latency, preventing things from getting out of sync on,
      e.g. BlueTooth-connected speakers.
    - Changed the way scripts are handled when they are stopped from the
      "unresponsive script" dialog, to prevent browser lockup. We will now stop
      all scripts in the affected compartment in one go.
    - Fixed several errors in the devtools.
    - Fixed a nasty crash caused by cross-origin referrers.
    - Added HTML5-spec clipboard handling for content (cut&copy only -- paste
      is not allowed for security reasons).
    - Made multiple changes to the toolkit jetpack modules to cater to PMkit
      extensions. This should make running SDK-based extensions as PMkit
      extensions fairly simple for extension developers.
    - Fixed a css layout issue: make max-width affect contributions to intrinsic
      min-width.
    - Implemented several updates to the permissions manager. Among others,
      improved the permissions manager (about:permissions) with a more complete
      set of permissions for pages.
    - Removed otherwise unused Metro browser platform/widget code.
    - Removed support for non-standard/deprecated let blocks and expressions.
    - Made the use of let as a keyword versionless and ES6 compliant.
    - Made the privacy category in preferences a tabbed setup to better fit the
      current options.
    - Fixed a regression preventing certain MP4 video files from playing.
    - Fixed a regression where seeking in media files would halt playback/jump
      to the end of the stream.
    - Fixed a crash caused by certain downloadable fonts with DirectWrite
      in use.
     -Improved downloads-button indicator legibility on some combinations of
      Windows versions and system theme colors.
    - Changed the Facebook user-agent override to be our native one, based on
      reports from users that it is (finally) working acceptably.
    - Fixed site-specific useragents being ignored if a global override is
      defined.

    Security/privacy changes:

    - Changed CORS handling to allow data: sources, assuming they are
      same-origin. This should fix the infamous "Facebook endless reload" issue
      and may make some other sites that assume this particular (unspecified)
      CORS behavior happy with Pale Moon.
    - Reinstated the network.stricttransportsecurity.enabled preference so
      people who choose privacy over HSTS can do so again.
    - Added, In HSTS "off" state, prevention of HSTS site status from being
      written to disk.
    - Updated the IDN blacklist with more extended unicode characters that
      "look very similar to" normal ASCII characters, to prevent spoofing of
      well-known domains. If blacklisted characters are found, the IDN domain
      name will be displayed in its punycode form. (CVE-2017-5383 and similar)
    - Fixed an exploitable crash when using MP4 video. (CVE-2017-5396)
    - Fixed an exploitable crash in XSL parsing. (CVE-2017-5376)
    - Fixed a potential security issue when exporting certificates with
      specially-crafted credentials. (CVE-2017-5381)
    - Fixed a potential use-after-free situation in frame selection.
      (CVE-2017-5380) DiD
    - Fixed a leak of window details through the Ion compiler in certain
      situations.
    - Fixed the potential for an exploitable crash involving Javascript GC. DiD
    - Fixed a potential overflow situation in (non-released) WebRTC code. DiD
    - Fixed a potentially unsafe situation in websockets. DiD
    - Fixed several memory and other safety hazards (BMO bugs 1318766, 1325877,
      1328834 DiD, 1288561 DiD, 1322420 DiD, 1293327 DiD, 1322315, 1325344,

  * New upstream release:
    Fixes/Changes:
    - Implemented a breaking CSP (content security policy) spec change; when a
      page with CSP is loaded over http, Pale Moon now interprets CSP directives
      to also include https versions of the hosts listed in CSP if a scheme
      (http/https) isn't explicitly listed. This breaks with CSP 1.0 which is
      more restrictive and doesn't allow this cross-protocol access, but is in
      line with CSP 2 where this is allowed.
    - Fixed an issue with the XML parser where it would sometimes end up in an
      unknown state and throw an error (e.g. when specific networking errors
      would occur).
    - Improved the performance of canvas poisoning by explicitly
      parallelizing it.

    Security fixes:
    - Fixed a potentially exploitable crash related to text writing direction.
      (CVE-2016-5280)
    - Made checking for invalid PNG files more strict. Pale Moon will now reject
      more PNG files that have corrupted/invalid data that could otherwise lead
      to potential security issues.
    - Changed the way paletted image frames are allocated so the space is
      cleared before it's used. DiD
    - Fixed a crash in nsNodeUtils::CloneAndAdopt() due to a typo. DiD
    - Fixed several memory safety errors.

palemoon (26.4.1~repack-1) obs; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    Changes/fixes:
    - Fixed a crash in the XSS filter.
    - Slightly changed the address bar shading on secure sites to be more subtle
      and easily-blended.
    - Fixed the occurrence of "null" titles in bookmarks dragged from special
     folders.
    - Fixed an error initializing the browser due to trying to restore
      scratchpad data from a stored session when having switched from a version
      with devtools to a version without devtools, and the previous version had
      scratchpad data saved.
    - Fixed some minor issues in scratchpad and gcli devtools.

    Security fixes:
    - Updated the HSTS preload list to a much more updated source list, and
      performing our own checks on validity from now on to have the list be as
      accurate as possible.
    - Disabled Triple-DES cipher suites by default (mitigating SWEET32).

  * Add a "~repack" to the versioning because we have to repack the source.

palemoon (26.4.0-1mx150+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Removed Google Search as a bundled search provider. If desired, you can
      manually install it (or other search engines) after the update by following
      the steps in the Manage Search Engines topic.
    - Fixed the URL API to allow "stringification" of the object per
      specification. This should make a number of websites happy.
    - Added the ES6 string .includes() function in addition to the pre-existing
      .contains() function for  checking if a string contains another string.
      The .contains() function is retained for compatibility with web and
      extension scripts that adhere to the ES6 pre-release specification up to
      and including RC3.
    - Fixed the calculation of standalone SVG embeds width and height, which
      should solve some reported issues with html5 graphs being displayed
      incorrectly.
    - Linux: improved memory allocation.
    - Updated the graphite font library to 1.3.9.
    - Added a blocking rule for F-Secure's 64-bit deepguard library to prevent
      crashes.
    - Updated the SQLite library to 3.13.0.
    - Download= properties of links are now honored from the context menu
      "Save" option.
    - Fixed a crash in the XSS filter.
    - Fixed a crash in the DOM error module.
    - Worked around a crash on Linux
    - Linux: Improved optimization and GCC6 compatibility (Note: compiling with
      GCC 6 is still not recommended and it may or may not work, depending on
      your environment)

    Security fixes:
    - (CVE-2016-5251)Potential URL spoofing in the address bar.
    - (CVE-2016-0718) Context-dependent crash in expat 2.1.0.
    - (CVE-2016-5266) Outgoing dataTransfer items are not properly filtered.
    - Fixed potentially exploitable crash in the array splice implementation.

palemoon (26.3.3-1mx150+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed an additional issue found that could cause menu text on Windows 10
      to be white-on-white (and therefore unreadable).
    - Fixed an issue with news feeds not showing up when embedded in web pages.
    - Removed recently-added parsing of the child-src content security policy
      directive, after some web compatibility issues with it came to light, as
      well as it becoming clear that the CSP spec will see it removed in favor
      of the previous directive for embedded content. This should fix some
      intermittent issues people have reported on e.g. the main google.com page
      and phpMyAdmin installations.

palemoon (26.3.2-1mx150+1) mx; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - 26.3.2 (2016-06-27) - Windows only
      This release only has pertinent changes for Windows. Other operating
      systems do not need this update.
      Changes/fixes:

     -Fixed a rare issue where the browser would not initialize properly
      (missing bookmarks and menu entries) if certain Windows registry values
      were missing (Windows 8 only).
     -Fixed an issue on Windows 10 where the classic menu bar would become
      unreadable (white on white).
     -Portable only: Switched to non-compressed binaries to prevent issues with
      antivirus packages, to prevent issues with browser run-time operation, and
      to simplify code signing.

    - 26.3.1 (2016-06-25)
      Changes/fixes:

     -Fixed an issue with new tab button theming on dark toolbars.
     -Reverted the useragent identification of Firefox compatibility mode to
      38.9 to avoid  WOFF2 font issues for sites that don't use proper font
      deployment as recommended by the W3C.
     -Added a site-specific override for Google fonts to make sure it always
      works even if not using Firefox compatibility mode. (workaround pending
      for a proper solution on Google's side)
     -Adjusted the "dark color" detection routine to switch text to white at
      higher relative contrast levels. This will more closely match Windows 10's
      "flip point" for different accent colors and is within the recommended
      range determined by the WCAG.

    - 26.3.0 (2016-06-21)
      Changes/fixes:

     -Added detection for dark system themes on Windows 10 and re-worked Windows
      10 specific theming to better integrate into the OS and provide more
      clarity.
     -HTML5 media controls have been reworked to a horizontal volume control on
      all media, including HTML5 audio that was previously without an
      element-control for volume.
     -Default HTML5 media volume preference added as media.default_volume --
      fractional, default 1.0 (=100%).
     -String.prototype.match() and .replace() are now fully spec compliant.
     -NSPR and NSS now correctly no longer enforce IA32 architecture
      compatibility, getting the advantage of SSE2 like the rest of the code.
     -Worked around crashes in the XSS filter when navigating back in history
      due to document fragments.
     -Instated a hard minimum of 10,000 places entries regardless of free disk
      space and total memory to prevent undesired expiration of history. That is
      around 16MB for an average entry size, which should be sane enough even on
      low-memory machines.
     -Fixed a typo in networking code introduced in 26.2.2 that would cause
      issues on some sites due to adding extra forward slashes to the URL.

    - Security fixes:

     -Fixed a number of memory safety hazards and potentially exploitable
      crashes.
     -Fixed CVE-2016-2821 Use-after-free in the mozilla::dom::Element class
     -Fixed netaddr deserialization for AF_UNSPEC and AF_LOCAL.
     -Fixed a memory overrun error in the VP8 encoder. DiD
     -Fixed non-threadsafe re-use of pixman images to prevent potential race
      conditions. DiD
     -Fixed CVE-2016-2825 Partial Same Origin Policy violation

palemoon (25.8.1-1mcr120+1) mepis; urgency=medium

  * A small update to address two important issues:
    - Fix for a crash that could occur at random since the update to 25.8.0.
    - Fix for CSP (Content Security Policy) to be more lenient towards the
      incorrect passing of full URLs with all sorts of parameters in the CSP
      header, leading to misinterpretation of the header and incorrectly
      blocking the loading of content.

palemoon (25.7.1-1mcr120+1) mepis; urgency=medium

  * New bugfix and maintenance release:

     Fixes/changes:

    - Code cleanup: Removed the majority of remaining telemetry code (including
      the data reporting back-end and health report) to prevent a few issues
      with partially removed code in earlier versions.
    - Fixed a crash due to handling of bogus URIs passed to CSS style filters
      (e.g. whatsapp's web interface).
    - Permitted spec-breaking syntax in Regex character classes, allowing
      ranges that would be permitted per the grammar rules in the spec but not
      necessarily following the syntax rules. This impacts a good number of
      (also higher profile) sites that use invalid ranges in regular
      expressions (e.g. Cisco's networking academy site, Yahoo Fantasy
      Football).
    - Fixed a crash due to the newly introduced WASAPI handling of audio
      channel mapping that doesn't like actual surround hardware setups (e.g.
      playing a video with quadraphonic audio on a 4-speaker setup).
    - Fixed an issue where site-specific dictionary selections would be written
      to content preferences without the user's action, potentially overwriting
      or clearing a previously-chosen dictionary.
    - Added support for drag and drop of local files from sources which use
      text/uri-lists. (Some Linux flavors/file managers)
    - Updated libnestegg to the most current version.
    - Fixed an issue where setting the location to an empty string could cause
      a reload loop.

      Security fixes:

    - Changed the jemalloc poison address to something that is not a NOP-slide.
      DiD
    - Fixed a memory safety hazard in ConvertDialogOptions (CVE-2015-4521)
    - Fixed a buffer overflow/crash hazard in the
      VertexBufferInterface::reserveVertexSpace function in libGLES in ANGLE
      (CVE-2015-7179)
    - Fixed an overflow/crash hazard in the XULContentSinkImpl::AddText function
      (CVE-2015-7175)
    - Fixed a stack buffer overread hazard in the ICC v4 profile parser
      (CVE-2015-4504)
    - Fixed an HTMLVideoElement Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution 0-day
      vulnerability (ZDI-CAN-3176) (CVE-2015-4509)
    - Fixed a potentially exploitable crash in nsXBLService::GetBinding
    - Fixed a memory safety hazard in nsAttrAndChildArray::GrowBy
      (CVE-2015-7174)
    - Fixed a memory safety hazard for callers of nsUnicodeToUTF8::GetMaxLength
      (CVE-2015-4522)
    - Fixed a heap buffer overflow/crash hazard caused by invalid WebM headers
      (CVE-2015-4511)

palemoon (25.7.0-1mcr120+1) mepis; urgency=medium

  * New bugfix and maintenance release:
    - Code cleanup: Removed the (otherwise unused) visual event tracer code.
    - Code cleanup: Removed reflow performance tracing code (telemetry).
    - Fixed a key JavaScript bug where defining properties on an object would
      wipe the object.
    - This seems to be a common issue with "modern" libraries that use "define"
      instead of "change" and expecting the other properties on the object to be
      retained, resulting in "x is undefined" errors all over the place if the
      object is wiped.
    - This aligns the behavior with ES6's "Validate and apply property
      descriptor" pseudo-function.
    - Updated the SQLite library to 3.8.11.1.
    - Added support for the element.matches() Web API function.
    - Added support for BASE tag parsing in source view. Previously, when
      viewing the source of a document, clickable links would be incorrect if a
      base path was specified in the document with this tag.
    - Fixed an issue with running timers after the computer would have been put
      to sleep with the browser opened.

     Security fixes:

    - Added protection against potential bugs where our SVG mPositions is out of
      sync with the characters in the DOM. DiD
    - Fixed use-after-free vulnerability in XMLHttpRequest::Open()
      (CVE-2015-4492)
    - Fixed use-after-free vulnerability in the StyleAnimationValue class
      (CVE-2015-4488)
    - Fixed crash or memory corruption in nsTArray (CVE-2015-4489)
    - Fixed crash or memory corruption in nsTSubstring::ReplacePrep
      (CVE-2015-4487)
    - Fixed potential escalation of privileges or crash (out-of-bounds write)
      via a crafted name in MARs (x64 only) -(CVE-2015-4482)
    - Fixed an issue that would allow man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass a
      mixed-content protection mechanism via a feed: URL in a POST request.
      (CVE-2015-4483)
  * Added blurb to postinst script.
